## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with the Budget App, follow the instructions below:

### 🛠 Setup <a name="setup"></a>

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadaf-Daneshgar/Hello_Rails_React.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd hello-rails-react
   ```
### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
Before you can run the Budget App, make sure you have the following prerequisites and configurations in place:

- **Ruby**: Ensure that Ruby is installed on your machine. You can check if it's installed by running `ruby -v` in your terminal. If it's not installed, you can download and install it from the [official Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

- **Ruby on Rails**: You'll need the Ruby on Rails framework installed. If you don't have it yet, you can install it using the following command:
  ```
  gem install rails
  ```

- **Code Editor**: You should have a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VSCode) installed. You can download VSCode from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **Git**: Git is essential for version control. Make sure you have Git installed and configured on your system. You can download Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- **PostgreSQL**: Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed and properly configured on the server where you are developing the project. This project assumes the use of PostgreSQL as the default database. You can download PostgreSQL from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

- **Ruby on Rails Configuration**: Make sure your Ruby on Rails project is configured to use PostgreSQL as the default database.

With these prerequisites and configurations in place, you'll be ready to set up and run the Blog App.

### 📖 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Follow these steps to use the Blog App:

Open your terminal.

Navigate to the directory where the project files are located:

Copy code
```
 For frontend only:
 cd frontend-react-app
 npm start  // git bash terminal
 For backend only:
 rails s    // wsl terminal
 ```ls server
```
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the Hello Rails React app.
